# Chapter 1 Architecture

第1章 架构



You can't build a system without some idea of what you want to build. And you can't build it if you don't know the environment in which it will work. 

你不知道构建什么的时候，你无法构建系统。同样如果你不了解它的工作环境，你也无法构建。

GUI programs are different to batch processing programs; games programs are different to business programs; and distributed programs are different to standalone programs. 

图形界面程序和批处理程序不同；游戏程序和商业程序不同；分布式程序和单机程序不同。

They each have their approaches, their common patterns, the problems that typically arise and the solutions that are often used.

它们都拥有自己的方式，共同的模式，*通常出现的问题，以及经常使用的解决方案*。

This chapter covers the high level architectural aspects of distributed systems. There are many ways of looking at such systems, and many of these are dealt with. 

本章介绍分布式系统的高级体系架构方面。有许多方法可以看这些系统，其中有许多方法已经在使用中。
